# Dungeon Explorer

## Overview

A work in progress dungeon exploration game where you go around in a dungeon trying to uncover it's secrets and find the monsters hidden within. This is just the demo and the game is still a work in progress. Multiplayer mode will be added soon!!

This was my first attempt at game development with godot, and I'm pretty proud with how it turned out. Still a work in progress, unfortunately the multiplayer ability will probably come after SoM ends but Single Player will mostly be done by then.

**NOTE: The game is currently going under a complete remake of the entity system which is why I couldn't add a respawn or end-of-game in this demo. You will have to reload the page to be able to play the game again.**
